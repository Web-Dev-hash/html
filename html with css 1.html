<h1>fastest thing in the world</h1>

<p>People have long had an obsession with fast things. From cars to cheetahs, airplanes to boats, our interest in speed is rivalled only by our fascination with waterfalls. And, while light is still by far the fastest thing in the universe, moving at a staggering speed of 299791.82 km/h, the following list contains some of the other closest things to reach that title of “World’s Fastest.”</p>

<p>1. Land animal: the cheetah

The oversized cat can accelerate from zero to 10km/h in three seconds flat, which is a terrifying thought if you find yourself in its territory. It's able to do this for a multitude of reasons: its enlarged nostrils (which allow for optimum oxygen intake), and its large heart and lungs that assist the circulation of oxygen in the body. Their semi-retractable claws also probably help, with the excellent traction they offer.
<br>2. Air animal: the peregrine falcon

This is the fastest animal in all the skies, with its ability to clock speeds of up to 325km/h -– making the cheetah look pretty, pretty slow in comparison. You can fly, but you can't hide.
<br>3. Sea animal: the black marlin

<br>4. Automotive: Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4

Speaking of speed limits, the Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4 is the fastest car with the ability to hit 431km/h.
<br>5. Airplane: Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird

While the peregrine falcon may be able to fly at incredible speeds, the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird is the king of the sky, with speeds of 3,530km/h. Buckle up.
<br>6. Train: JR-Maglev

On the rails, the Japanese JR-Maglev is the fastest at 603km/h. The Maglev hovers 10 cm above the tracks, and is propelled by electrically charged magnets.
<br>7. Rapper: Twista

Twista takes the title of faster rapper, with his ability to rap 280 words in a minute. Give it a crack, and see if you can achieve this greatness without sounding like an over excited, rambling auctioneer.
<br>8. Painter: Morris Katz

Morris Katz was a Polish-American painter, who holds two Guinness World Records as the world's fastest painter. He used to have his own television show called The Instant Art Show during which he would churn through canvas after canvas while people watched on.
<br>9. Kickstarter campaign: Pebble Time

The smartwatch Pebble Time was the fastest Kickstarter project to reach $1 million. By a lot. It reached $1 million in an impressive half hour.
<br>10. Social platform to get to 1 million users: Tsu

It took Facebook 10 months to reach the million user mark, whereas New York-based newcomer Tsu got there in just under four months. Watch out Mark Zuckerberg!
<br>11. YouTube video to reach 100 million views: “Gentleman” — PSY

The “Gangnam Style” king outdid himself with his hilarious video clip, “Gentleman,” which reached 100 million views in just three days.

Nike has endorsed track athletes for decades, helping them to be the fastest version of themselves possible. Just look at Nike athlete Allyson Felix -– the American track and field sprint star who competes internationally for the United States. Her speed specialty is the 200 metres and has won the 2012 Olympic gold, two Olympic silver medals and three World Championship gold medals. Her personal best for the 200m currently stands at 21.69 seconds. Or, Australian Ryan Gregson, another Nike athlete, who competed in the 2012 Olympics and is currently the Australian 1500M Record Holder. While everyone's version of fast differs (we can't all be the human equivalent of a cheetah, a la Felix and Gregson), Nike can help you get on the right track</p>
